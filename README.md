# Disease Prediction System

## Overview

The Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based tool that leverages advanced algorithms to predict potential diseases based on input data. This system aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in early detection and risk assessment of diseases. It is designed to process various health parameters and outputs a risk assessment or diagnosis, helping users take proactive measures.

## Features

- **Disease Prediction:** Based on user input such as symptoms, medical history, and test results, the system predicts possible diseases.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for easy data input and result visualization.
- **Real-Time Prediction:** The system provides real-time predictions based on the latest input data.
- **Multi-Disease Detection:** Capable of predicting a wide range of diseases based on patterns learned from data.
- **Customizable:** Can be adapted to include additional features or prediction models depending on user needs.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Machine Learning Libraries:**
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the model used)
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
- **Optional:**
  - Flask or Django for web-based interface (if applicable)
  - SQLite or any database for storing user data (if applicable)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
  

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have the necessary datasets for training the model. You can either train the model yourself or use pre-trained weights if available.

1. **Input Data:** Provide the necessary input data for prediction. This could be done through a web interface, API, or command line interface (CLI), depending on your setup.
2. **Model Prediction:** The model will process the input and return a prediction based on the trained model.
3. **Interpret Results:** The output will include the predicted disease(s), along with confidence scores or risk levels.
